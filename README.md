# AICharacters
This is a work in progress project that will eventually allow users to create AI characters
to interface with the user using Speech To Text as an input and Text To Speech as output for the AI.

## Goals
- [x] Working AI Conversations with Saving and Reloading
- [ ] Friendly interface for creating and saving various AI characters
- [ ] Text to Speech for Reading of Prompts with multiple voices
- [ ] Speech to Text for providing text input to the AI
- [ ] Integrations with OBS for a graphical representation of the AI character
- [ ] Discord bot for interfacing with the AI (future project?)

## Inspiration
This is heavily inspired by the AI character's commonly seen on DougDoug's live streams. He has released the code here titled [Babagaboosh](https://github.com/DougDougGithub/Babagaboosh). 
As an attempt to try and learn more about using LLMs, programming, and simply to have some fun, I am trying to fully recreate his program as much as I can without referencing his code. 
I also aim to create the program without utilizing paid APIs such as OpenAI and ElevenLabs.
