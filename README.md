# AICharacters
WIP Discord Bot that will allow for AI conversations, stream interactions, TTS, etc.

## Goals
- [x] Bot allows conversation with locally run LLM
- [x] Ability to create TTS for the output
    - [ ] Different TTS voices
- [x] Interact with OBS to allow for interactive streams using AI through the bot
- [ ] Multiple characters with different personalities and usages through discord
- [ ] Point based usage system that are gained through time watching the stream / other means

The end goal for this bot when completed is it will allow for a player to play a game for example while having their audience interact with the stream through the AI bot.
These interactions could include be all sorts of things such as challenges that are generated through user provided prompts and played back through TTS.

## Inspiration
This is heavily inspired by the AI character's commonly seen on DougDoug's live streams. He has released the code here titled [Babagaboosh](https://github.com/DougDougGithub/Babagaboosh). 
As an attempt to try and learn more about using LLMs, programming, and simply to have some fun, I am trying to recreate some functionality from his program and more.
