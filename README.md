# AICharacters
WIP Discord Bot that will allow for AI conversations, stream interactions, TTS, etc.

## Goals
- [x] Working AI Conversations with Saving and Reloading
- [ ] Friendly interface for creating and saving various AI characters
- [ ] Text to Speech for Reading of Prompts with multiple voices
- [ ] Speech to Text for providing text input to the AI
- [ ] Integrations with OBS for a graphical representation of the AI character
- [ ] Discord bot for interfacing with the AI

## Inspiration
This is heavily inspired by the AI character's commonly seen on DougDoug's live streams. He has released the code here titled [Babagaboosh](https://github.com/DougDougGithub/Babagaboosh). 
As an attempt to try and learn more about using LLMs, programming, and simply to have some fun, I am trying to fully recreate his program and more. I also aim to create the program without utilizing paid APIs such as OpenAI and ElevenLabs.
